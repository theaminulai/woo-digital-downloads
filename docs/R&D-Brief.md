## 1. Product Summary

 Woo Digital Downloads for WooCommerce turns an existing WooCommerce store into a focused platform for selling downloadable products, software, media, documents, and other licensed digital goods.

WooCommerce remains responsible for the catalog, cart, checkout, payment gateways, taxes, coupons, orders, refunds, customers, and base transactional emails.  Woo Digital Downloads adds secure file delivery, a better customer download experience, product releases, access management, download analytics, and optional software licensing.

The product is an alternative to installing a separate digital-commerce system such as Easy Digital Downloads. It is not a replacement for WooCommerce.

## 2. Problem Statement

WooCommerce supports virtual and downloadable products, but a serious digital-product business commonly needs more:

- Stronger file protection and expiring links
- Multiple releases and product version history
- Better download permission management
- Detailed access and download logs
- A purpose-built customer download dashboard
- Software license generation and activation
- Cloud file storage
- Subscription-aware access
- Digital-product reporting

Merchants currently assemble several extensions or move to a separate commerce platform.  Woo Digital Downloads should provide these capabilities through one coherent WooCommerce-native experience.

## 3. Target Customers

## 8. Proposed Architecture

### Components

- **Bootstrap:** dependency checks, activation, migrations, service container
- **Product:** product settings, file sources, releases, validation
- **Entitlement:** access lifecycle and WooCommerce order synchronization
- **Delivery:** token creation, authorization, rate limiting, streaming
- **Customer:** My Account endpoints and templates
- **Admin:** entitlement, release, and log screens
- **Reporting:** aggregation, queries, exports, retention
- **Email:** WooCommerce-compatible email classes
- **REST:** licensing and integration endpoints
- **Storage:** local and cloud-provider contracts
- **CLI:** maintenance, migration, and diagnostic commands

### Suggested database tables

Use dedicated tables for high-volume transactional data rather than post meta.

- `{prefix} Woo Digital Downloads_files`
- `{prefix} Woo Digital Downloads_releases`
- `{prefix} Woo Digital Downloads_entitlements`
- `{prefix} Woo Digital Downloads_download_logs`
- `{prefix} Woo Digital Downloads_licenses` (Pro)
- `{prefix} Woo Digital Downloads_activations` (Pro)

Tables should include appropriate composite indexes, UTC timestamps, schema versions, and explicit retention behavior. WooCommerce order and product IDs remain the canonical commerce references.

### Compatibility requirements

- Current WordPress-supported PHP versions
- WooCommerce HPOS
- WooCommerce Cart and Checkout Blocks
- Classic checkout
- WordPress multisite evaluation
- Object caching
- Action Scheduler
- Local and remote file storage
- Translation and RTL layouts
- GDPR export and erasure tools

## 9. Security Requirements

- Never expose permanent local storage paths
- Use cryptographically secure random tokens
- Sign tokens and compare signatures safely
- Bind access to an entitlement and file identifier
- Enforce expiration and download limits server-side
- Sanitize input and escape output at the correct boundary
- Use nonces for administrative mutations
- Check capabilities for every privileged action
- Protect REST endpoints with explicit permission callbacks
- Prevent directory traversal, URL injection, and insecure redirects
- Rate-limit repeated failures and license validation abuse
- Redact sensitive token data from logs
- Document web-server protection rules and failure modes
- Include security tests for authorization and refund transitions

## 10. Performance Requirements

- Do not load  Woo Digital Downloads services on unrelated front-end requests
- Use indexed custom tables for logs and entitlements
- Process emails, release notifications, and aggregation asynchronously
- Paginate all administrative logs
- Stream large files without loading them fully into PHP memory
- Support HTTP range behavior only after a security and compatibility review
- Cache derived reports, not authorization decisions
- Provide configurable log retention and cleanup jobs

## 11. UX Requirements

### Merchant experience

- Guided setup after activation
- Sensible secure defaults
- Clear dependency and configuration diagnostics
- Product-level settings written in merchant language
- No requirement to understand WooCommerce permission internals
- Actionable failure messages

### Customer experience

- Reach a purchased file in two clicks or fewer after login
- Clearly show why a download is unavailable
- Avoid exposing security terminology
- Accessible keyboard navigation and status messaging
- Consistent presentation in email, order confirmation, and My Account

## 12. Business Model

### Free core

- Local protected delivery
- Multiple files
- Expiring links and limits
- Customer download library
- Entitlement administration
- Basic logs and reports
- Developer hooks

### Pro plan

- Product releases and update notifications
- Advanced reporting
- Cloud storage
- Software licensing
- Subscription bridge
- Priority support

### Optional standalone modules

- Licensing
- Cloud storage provider pack
- Subscriptions integration
- Growth and marketing tools

The free version must solve a complete digital-delivery problem. Pro should monetize operational scale and advanced business models rather than basic security.

## 13. Success Metrics

- Setup-to-first-protected-product completion rate
- Successful download rate
- Authorization-denial false-positive rate
- Support tickets per 1,000 orders

## 16. Key Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| File URLs leak through storage configuration | Critical | Protected storage checks, diagnostics, documentation |
| Order hooks run repeatedly | High | Idempotent entitlement operations and unique constraints |
| Refund behavior removes valid access | High | Explicit policies and line-item-aware tests |
| Large files exhaust PHP resources | High | Streaming, offload adapters, host diagnostics |
| WooCommerce updates change checkout behavior | High | Blocks-first compatibility tests and release matrix |
| Logging creates oversized tables | Medium | Indexed queries, retention settings, scheduled cleanup |
| Licensing API is abused | High | Rate limits, signed requests where appropriate, audit logs |
| Product name conflicts legally | High | Trademark and marketplace review before branding investment |

## 17. MVP Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is ready for beta when:

- A merchant can protect multiple files on a WooCommerce product
- A paid order creates the correct entitlement exactly once
- An authorized customer can download through an expiring URL
- An unauthorized, expired, revoked, or exhausted URL is rejected
- Refund behavior follows the configured policy
- An administrator can find and manage access
- A customer can retrieve all eligible purchases from My Account
- HPOS, classic checkout, and Checkout Blocks pass the test matrix
- Large-file delivery does not exceed the documented memory profile
- No critical issues remain after an independent security review

## 18. Immediate Research Tasks

1. Map WooCommerce download-permission APIs and order-status hooks.
2. Decide whether MVP entitlements wrap or replace WooCommerce download permissions.
3. Benchmark local streaming against server offload and signed cloud redirects.
4. Define partial-refund behavior for multi-item orders.
5. Prototype the My Account library with 1,000 purchases.
6. Test Checkout Blocks messaging and account-creation flows.
7. Interview merchants about releases versus simple file replacement.
8. Complete trademark, WordPress.org slug, domain, and social-handle checks.

## 19. Competitive Pricing Research

### EDD pricing snapshot

The supplied Easy Digital Downloads pricing screenshot was reviewed on June 21, 2026. It shows promotional annual prices at approximately 50% below the displayed regular prices. Pricing is time-sensitive and must be rechecked before making launch decisions.

| EDD plan | Promotional price shown | Regular price shown | Sites | Main expansion point |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Personal | $99.50/year | $199/year | 1 | Entry-level selling and reporting |
| Extended | $199.50/year | $399/year | 1 | Bundles, reviews, content restriction, Zapier, multi-currency |
| Professional | $299.50/year | $599/year | 2 | Software licensing, marketplace, commissions, funnels |
| All Access | $499.50/year | $999/year | 3 | Fraud tools, advanced reports, loyalty, bulk discounts, comparisons |

### Feature ladder visible in the screenshot

**Personal:** unlimited products, checkout and cart, subscriptions and trials, Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, discounts, EU VAT, AI recommendations, abandoned-cart recovery, revenue reporting, and standard support.

**Extended:** adds Authorize.net and 2Checkout, multi-currency, content restriction, product bundles, customer reviews, Zapier, and related growth capabilities.

**Professional:** adds software licensing and API, multi-vendor marketplace, commissions and payouts, recommended products, wish lists, physical shipping, and post-purchase funnels.

**All Access:** adds loyalty and rewards, fraud prevention, advanced reports, bulk discount generation, product comparisons, direct customer messaging, and the broadest feature access.

### Important comparison rule

EDD is a commerce platform, while  Woo Digital Downloads is a WooCommerce add-on. A raw checklist comparison would therefore be misleading. The following screenshot features are already substantially supplied by WooCommerce or its established ecosystem:

- Products, cart, checkout, orders, and refunds
- Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, and other payment gateways
- Coupons and discount codes
- Taxes and VAT integrations
- Physical-product shipping
- Revenue reporting
- Product reviews
- Related and recommended products
- Subscriptions, bundles, marketplace, loyalty, and wish-list extensions

 Woo Digital Downloads should integrate with these WooCommerce capabilities. It should not duplicate them merely to match EDD's pricing table.

### Competitive feature focus for  Woo Digital Downloads

| Capability | WooCommerce role |  Woo Digital Downloads opportunity | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secure file delivery | Basic downloadable files | Signed links, protected sources, limits, audit trail | MVP |
| Customer download library | Basic account downloads | Product-centric library, releases, docs, access states | MVP |
| Entitlement management | Download permissions | Searchable access records, policies, manual controls | MVP |
| Product releases | File replacement | Versions, changelog, eligibility, update notifications | Pro |
| Software licensing | Requires another extension | Keys, activations, validation API, updates | Pro |
| Cloud storage | Limited/provider-dependent | S3-compatible adapters and signed redirects | Pro |
| Subscription access | Extension-dependent | Bridge subscription state to downloads and licenses | Pro |
| Download analytics | Limited | Success, denial, abuse, product, customer, retention | Plus/Pro |
| Marketplace integration | Established extensions exist | Compatibility with vendor ownership and commissions | Later |

### Recommended  Woo Digital Downloads packaging hypothesis

These are starting hypotheses for customer interviews and pricing tests, not final prices.

|  Woo Digital Downloads plan | Target annual price | Sites | Proposed scope |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Free | $0 | 1 | Protected local delivery, limits, customer library, basic logs |
| Plus | $79 | 1 | Releases, update emails, advanced logs and reports |
| Pro | $149 | 3 | Software licensing, REST API, subscription bridge |
| Agency | $299 | 25 | Pro features, cloud adapters, priority support, client use |

### Pricing rationale

-  Woo Digital Downloads can enter below EDD because the merchant already has WooCommerce handling commerce fundamentals.
- The free edition must demonstrate secure delivery and produce a complete customer journey.
- Software licensing is the clearest high-value upgrade trigger.
- Site limits should be simpler and more generous than the screenshot's one-to-three-site structure.
- Do not market "no platform fees" as a unique benefit; WooCommerce merchants already expect that.
- Avoid permanent 50%-off framing. Use transparent renewal pricing and limited launch offers.
- Validate willingness to pay separately for creators, software vendors, and agencies.

### Recommended comparison-page message

> Keep WooCommerce. Add the digital-product tools it is missing.

The comparison page should measure fewer, more relevant outcomes: secure delivery, access control, release management, licensing, cloud storage, customer self-service, and WooCommerce compatibility.

## 20. Recommended Product Decision

Build  Woo Digital Downloads as a focused WooCommerce extension that owns **delivery and entitlement**, not commerce. Release a useful free core with secure local delivery and a customer library. Monetize licensing, cloud storage, subscriptions, and operational tooling through Pro modules.

This boundary gives the product a clear reason to exist while retaining the strongest part of WooCommerce: its checkout, payments, orders, and integration ecosystem.
