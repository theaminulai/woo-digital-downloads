# RND — Subscription Module
**Plugin:** woo-digital-downloads
**Module:** Subscriptions
**Phase:** 2
**Standalone:** Yes — works independently; links to Licensing and SaaS modules when both are active
**Third-party dependency:** None — fully built-in

---

## Overview

The Subscriptions module is a complete, self-contained recurring billing management system built directly into WDD. It adds a subscription product type to WooCommerce, handles recurring billing via Stripe and PayPal (through WooCommerce's gateway layer), manages the full subscription lifecycle (trial → active → paused → cancelled → expired), and ties renewals directly to license expiry and SaaS account status when those modules are enabled.

This is not a billing layer wrapper — it is a full subscription engine.

---

## Standalone Usage

Enable this module in **Settings → Digital Downloads → Modules → Subscriptions**.

Without any other WDD module:
- Create subscription products with recurring pricing, free trials, sign-up fees
- Auto-renew via Stripe or PayPal
- Customer self-service: pause, resume, cancel, change payment method, upgrade/downgrade
- Admin: manage all subscriptions, trigger manual renewals, bulk actions
- Dunning: configurable retry and email sequence on payment failure
- Reports: active/expired/cancelled counts, revenue from subscriptions, CSV export

With **Licensing** enabled: renewal automatically extends license expiry.
With **SaaS** enabled: suspension automatically suspends the SaaS account.

| Pause subscription | Customer can pause (vacation mode); billing suspended, access maintained during pause; next_payment_at advances by pause duration on resume |
| Resume subscription | Resume from paused state; next billing recalculated from resume date |
| Skip next renewal | Customer skips one upcoming renewal; next_payment_at jumps one interval; license/SaaS access extends to cover the skipped cycle |
| Cancel subscription | Customer cancels; cancellation flow triggers retention steps before confirming; access continues to period end |
| Change payment method | Customer updates card/PayPal for future renewals |
| Upgrade plan | Switch to higher-tier product; 3 proration modes: Prorate Immediately, Apply at Renewal, No Proration |

| Resubscribe | Re-activate a cancelled or expired subscription |
| Update quantity | Change subscription quantity (if product allows) |
| View renewal history | Full log of payments, status changes, retries |

---

### 3. Admin Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Admin subscription list | Sortable list table of all subscriptions |
| Filter subscriptions | Filter by status, product, customer, date range |
| Subscription detail page | View all details, payment log, status history |
| Manual status change | Admin changes status with reason and hook fires |
| Manual renewal trigger | Admin forces renewal from detail page |

---

### 4. Renewal Methods

| Method | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Auto-renewal via Stripe | WooCommerce Stripe Gateway active |
| Auto-renewal via PayPal | WooCommerce PayPal Payments active |
| Auto-renewal via PayPal Subscriptions | PayPal Subscriptions API (billing agreements) |
| Manual renewal | Customer pays renewal invoice manually via any WC gateway |
| Fallback to manual | If auto-renewal fails or is cancelled, subscription switches to manual mode |

Auto-renewal uses the payment token stored by the gateway on initial purchase. WDD does not store card data — it stores the gateway's token reference.

---

### 5. Notifications (Email)

All emails use WooCommerce's HTML email infrastructure. Templates overridable in `your-theme/woocommerce/emails/`.

| Email | Trigger | Customizable |
|---|---|---|
| Subscription created | Order completed with subscription product | Yes |
| Trial started | Subscription enters trialing status | Yes |

| Renewal reminder | N days before renewal (configurable; multiple reminders) | Yes |
| Renewal successful | Payment captured successfully | Yes |
| Payment failed | Auto-renewal charge fails | Yes |
| Payment retry scheduled | Dunning retry queued | Yes |
| Overdue notice | Payment still outstanding — active grace period | Yes |

Payment Failed (Dunning Sequence — 2-phase grace via Action Scheduler)
    │
    ├── Day 0:   Status → 'past_due'. Send "Payment failed" email.
    │            License / SaaS access REMAINS ACTIVE (active grace phase).
    ├── Day N:   Retry charge (configurable retry intervals e.g. [1,3,5]).

                 [If Licensing] License stays until expires_at then expires naturally (no forced revoke).

Customer Pauses Subscription
    │

## Upgrade / Downgrade with Proration

```
Customer upgrades from Plan A ($49/mo) to Plan B ($99/mo)
    │
    └── PlanUpgrade::process($subscription_id, $new_product_id)
            ├── Calculate days_remaining = (next_payment_at - NOW()) in days
            ├── Calculate days_in_cycle = billing_interval in days
            ├── Unused credit = (days_remaining / days_in_cycle) × Plan A price
            ├── Prorated charge = Plan B price − unused_credit
            ├── Create WC order for prorated amount
            ├── Charge immediately via stored gateway token
            ├── UPDATE wp_wdd_subscriptions {product_id = Plan B, price = $99}
            ├── [If Licensing] UPDATE plan_type and activation_limit
            └── next_payment_at = NOW() + billing_interval (reset cycle)

Downgrade: same logic, issue store credit for the difference instead of charging
```

Three proration modes are configurable per product (`_wdd_sub_proration`) and globally (`wdd_sub_proration_mode`):

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `prorate_immediately` | Calculate unused credit + charge/refund difference immediately. Reset cycle from today. |
| `apply_at_renewal` | No charge today. New price takes effect at next renewal. Cycle date unchanged. |
| `no_proration` | Switch product immediately. Customer pays new full price at next renewal. No credit issued. |

Default: `apply_at_renewal`.

## Retention Flow (Cancellation)

When a customer initiates cancellation, a retention flow is presented before the subscription is cancelled. This is inspired by ArraySubs and is Phase 2.

```
Customer clicks "Cancel" → Retention Flow starts
    │
    ├── Step 1: Cancellation reason selection (configurable list)
    │       Options: "Too expensive", "Not using it", "Missing features", "Switching provider", "Other"
    │
    └── Step 2: Retention offer (based on reason — configurable per reason or global)
            ├── Offer type A: Discount coupon  → Apply X% off for N renewals
            ├── Offer type B: Pause            → Offer to pause instead of cancel
            ├── Offer type C: Skip next cycle  → Skip the next billing charge
            └── Offer type D: Downgrade        → Switch to a lower-tier plan
                │
                ├── Customer accepts offer → Apply offer, cancel flow aborted, log retention
                └── Customer declines offer → Proceed with cancellation as normal
```

Retention data is stored in subscription logs and surfaced in admin reports (reason breakdown, offer acceptance rate).

**Product meta:** `_wdd_sub_retention_enabled` (bool), `_wdd_sub_retention_reasons` (JSON array), `_wdd_sub_retention_offer_type` (string).

---

## One Trial Per Customer

When `wdd_sub_one_trial_per_customer` is enabled, the trial period is only available to customers who have never trialled this product before.

```php
// On checkout: if product has trial AND option is enabled
$used = get_user_meta( $user_id, '_wdd_trial_used_' . $product_id, true );
if ( $used ) {
    // Strip trial from subscription; charge full price from Day 1
}

// On trial conversion (first charge collected):
update_user_meta( $user_id, '_wdd_trial_used_' . $product_id, true );
```

Meta key per product: `_wdd_trial_used_{product_id}`. This prevents trial abuse via cancel + resubscribe.

---

## Stepped Renewal Pricing

Allows an introductory price for the first N billing cycles, then a permanent step to the regular price.

**Example:** $9/mo for 3 months, then $29/mo ongoing.

```
Product meta:
    _wdd_sub_price      = 9.00   (introductory price)
    _wdd_sub_step_price = 29.00  (price after N cycles)
    _wdd_sub_step_after = 3      (switch after cycle 3)

DB: wp_wdd_subscriptions.renewal_count (INT) — incremented on each successful renewal.

RenewalEngine::process_renewal():
    if step_price > 0 AND renewal_count >= step_after:
        use step_price for this renewal order
```

**DB addition:** add `renewal_count INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT 0` to `wp_wdd_subscriptions`.

---

## Renewal Sync

When enabled, all subscriptions for a product align to a fixed calendar date (e.g., the 1st of each month). This simplifies accounting and revenue prediction.

```
Customer subscribes on June 15.
wdd_sub_renewal_sync = true, wdd_sub_renewal_sync_date = 1

First payment: prorated amount for June 15 → July 1 (16 days / 30 days × price).
Second payment: full price on July 1.
All subsequent: 1st of each month.
```

When sync is enabled, the first renewal order is a partial charge (prorated to the sync date). Thereafter, billing is always on the configured day of month.

---

## Role Mapping

WDD can automatically assign WordPress user roles based on subscription status. Useful for gating content behind subscriber roles (e.g., MemberPress-style).

| Status transition | Role action |
|---|---|
| Trial starts | Assign `wdd_sub_trial_role` (if configured) |
| Trial converts → active | Remove trial role, assign `wdd_sub_active_role` |
| Active → suspended / cancelled / expired | Remove active role, assign `wdd_sub_cancelled_role` |
| Resubscribe | Re-assign active role |

**Implementation:** `RoleManager` class listens to `wdd_subscription_status_changed` action. Uses `wp_update_user` / `WP_User::add_role()` / `WP_User::remove_role()`.

Roles are per-subscription-product, configured via product meta: `_wdd_sub_role_trial`, `_wdd_sub_role_active`, `_wdd_sub_role_cancelled`.

### Key WDD Differentiators

1. **License-linked renewals** — renewal payment automatically extends software license expiry; no manual work
2. **SaaS-linked renewals** — renewal re-activates a suspended SaaS account automatically
3. **Built into WDD** — no separate plugin install, no compatibility risk with WDD modules
4. **CSV export** — SUMO Subscriptions lacks this; WC Subscriptions requires extra steps
5. **Unified admin** — subscriptions, licenses, and downloads in one admin area
