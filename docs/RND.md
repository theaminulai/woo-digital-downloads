# R&D Document — woo-digital-downloads
**Project:** `woo-digital-downloads`
**Path:** `D:\wampserver\www\wp-plugin\digital-downloads\wp-content\plugins\woo-digital-downloads`
**Date:** 2026-06-24
**Goal:** A WooCommerce extension that sells and manages WordPress Plugins and SaaS Products from a single platform — with licensing, auto-updates, secure downloads, subscription billing, SaaS provisioning, and anti-piracy built in.

> **Modular Architecture:** Every feature in this plugin is independently operable. A store selling only downloadable files can enable just the Downloads module. A store needing only license keys enables only Licensing. A SaaS company can run only SaaS Provisioning. Features integrate with each other when both are enabled but never require one another unless explicitly noted.

### 1.4 SUMO Subscriptions for WooCommerce
**URL:** https://codecanyon.net/item/sumo-subscriptions-woocommerce-subscription-system/16486054
**By:** FantasticPlugins | **Price:** $49 | **Sales:** 5,063 | **Rating:** 4.38/5 | **Version:** 17.5.0 (Feb 2026)

Multiple subscriptions per checkout. Free trial + paid trial. Sign-up fee. Switching between identical variations. Upgrade/Downgrade with prorate or full price. Payment synchronization. Customer-selectable renewal frequency and instalment count.

#### Renewal Methods
Auto-renewal via Stripe (requires WooCommerce Stripe Plugin), PayPal (requires WooCommerce PayPal Payments), PayPal Subscriptions (billing agreements), SUMO Reward Points (requires their separate plugin). Manual renewal via any WC gateway. Falls back to manual renewal if auto-renewal is cancelled.

#### Subscriber Controls
Pause, Cancel, Resubscribe. Update subscription quantity.

#### Digital Product Features
Drip downloadable content, additional digital downloads, manually create subscription orders for any user, include/exclude shipping in renewal.

#### Admin Features

#### Discount & Coupon Types
Sign-up fee coupon type. Recurring fee coupon type.

#### Admin Panel Structure

**Main subscription list table columns:** Subscription ID, Customer, Status, Recurring Amount, Next Payment Date, Actions (Edit / View / Cancel).

**Settings tabs:**

| Tab | Purpose | Key Options |
|---|---|---|
| General Settings | Global behavior | Enable/disable, cart behavior, trial settings |
| Order Subscription | Link subs to orders | Auto-renewal orders, order status sync |
| Synchronization | Gateway/CRM sync | Stripe/PayPal webhook URLs |

| My Account | Customer portal | Shortcodes, allow pause/cancel |
| Advanced | Technical config | Cron intervals, debug mode |
| Bulk Actions | Scale management | Bulk status changes, retry payments |
| Messages | Communications | Email/SMS templates |

**Role-Based Access:**

| Area | Admin | Shop Manager | Customer |
|---|---|---|---|
| General Settings | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Bulk Actions | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| My Account portal | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own only) |

#### Add-On Dependencies (weaknesses)
- Membership subscriptions require separate SUMO Memberships plugin

- No plugin update server
- No SaaS account provisioning
- No signed download tokens

### 1.5 Abandoned Cart Recovery — Ecosystem Research

| Plugin | Price | Installs | Rating | Notable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cart Abandonment Recovery (Brainstorm Force) | Free | 300,000+ | 4.8/5 | Market leader, free coupons, 1-click recovery |
| WC Recover Abandoned Cart (FantasticPlugins) | $49 | 4,984 sales | 4.70/5 | Segmentation, manual mailing, multi-currency |
| Abandoned Cart Lite (Tychesoftwares) | Free | 20,000+ | 4.1/5 | Webhooks in free tier, Action Scheduler |
| CartBounty | Free | 10,000+ | 4.8/5 | Exit Intent free, anonymous cart capture, best hooks |

**WDD Strategy:** Fire `wdd_cart_abandoned` / `wdd_cart_recovered` action hooks — any of these plugins can integrate.

---

### 1.6 Affiliate Management — Ecosystem Research

| Plugin | Price | Sales | Rating | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SUMO Affiliates for WooCommerce | $39 | 620 | 4.25/5 | WooCommerce-only |
| SUMO Affiliates Pro | $49 | 954 | 4.53/5 | Any WordPress site, form/email commissions |

**WDD Strategy:** Webhook bridge — fire events on `license_activated`, `order_completed`, `subscription_renewed` so affiliate plugins can consume commission data.

---

### 1.7 Free Subscription Billing Alternatives

| Plugin | Price | Installs | Rating | Notable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Subscriptions for WooCommerce (WP Swings) | Free | 10,000+ | 4.4/5 | Subscription Box, AI widget, LearnPress |
| Subscription & Recurring Payment (Convers Lab) | Free | 700+ | 4.9/5 | iDEAL/SEPA free, highest rated |
| Subscriptions by Sublium (FunnelKit) | Free + 2.9% fee | 300+ | 5.0/5 | Variable products + installments free, FunnelKit ecosystem |

**WDD Position:** WDD builds its own full subscription engine (see `docs/RND-subscriptions.md`). It handles recurring billing via Stripe and PayPal through WooCommerce's gateway layer, plus links subscription state to license expiry and SaaS account status. WDD does not depend on any of the free plugins above.

---

### 1.8 License Key / Serial Number Managers — Direct Competitor

**WC Serial Numbers (PluginEver):** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-serial-numbers/
Free + Pro | 1,000+ installs | 4.7/5 | Updated May 2026

Pre-generated key delivery: import keys via CSV/TXT, auto-deliver on order complete, HTTP API + REST API for validate/activate/deactivate, DB encryption, customer portal, HPOS + Blocks + WPML. Pro adds: key generator, variable products, bulk export, Twilio SMS.

**WDD vs WC Serial Numbers:**
| | WC Serial Numbers | woo-digital-downloads |
|---|---|---|
| Key generation | Import or Pro generator | Dynamic random_bytes() — no import needed |
| Activation tracking | Basic API | Full domain+environment with staging exemption |
| Update delivery | Not included | /wdd/v1/plugin/update-check |
| ZIP versioning | Not included | Multi-channel, checksum, changelog |
| SaaS provisioning | Not included | Full webhook-based |
| Download tokens | Not included | Signed expiring tokens per order |
| Geo-blocking | Not included | Country-level block list |

---

### 1.9 Download Manager (WPDM) + Premium Packages

**Download Manager:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-manager/
Free + Pro | 100,000+ installs | 4.1/5 | Updated June 2026 (v3.3.58)

**Premium Packages (WPDM add-on):** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpdm-premium-packages/
Free | 3,000+ installs | 3.8/5 | Updated Jan 2026 (v6.2.0)

WPDM is a standalone file management and digital store system — it is NOT a WooCommerce extension. It runs its own cart, checkout, and PayPal integration. Premium Packages is a free add-on that adds ecommerce to WPDM.

**What WPDM does well (features to study):**
- Ad blocker detection with custom message and download link disable
- Video file protection: allow play but block download
- Media library file protection
- Integrated document viewer (DOC, PDF, PowerPoint) — Microsoft Office preview API
- Server file browser + asset manager with version management (Pro)
- Color scheme (System/Light/Dark) with dark mode support
- Chunk upload to override HTTP max upload limit
- Category-level access control
- Download speed control
- IP block list for bot prevention
- CBC bit-flipping attack protection on Crypt class (fixed v3.3.41)
- Free Google Drive, Dropbox, Box.com, OneDrive adapters (15–10 GB free)

**What Premium Packages does well (features to study):**
- Mini cart widget in 3 styles: dropdown, slide panel, floating button — with nav menu integration
- `[wpdmpp_pay_link]` shortcode: accept payment without creating a product (dynamic product)
- "Pay What You Want" pricing with minimum floor
- License-based price tiers: Personal / Extended / Unlimited per product
- Order expiration (e.g., 1-year support access, then renewal prompt)
- Abandoned cart recovery: up to 5 follow-up emails with dynamic coupon codes
- Email cart to someone else / save cart for later
- Sell extra services (gigs) as add-ons at checkout
- 2-click checkout — simplest possible checkout for digital goods
- Manual order creation from admin

**WPDM Weaknesses / WDD Opportunity:**
- Not WooCommerce native — merchants must maintain a second commerce system
- Critical review: "People end up downloading content for FREE" — delivery security gap
- No staging/local environment exemption for licenses
- PayPal only (Stripe requires paid add-on)
- No SaaS provisioning, no JWT, no GitHub sync
- No WooCommerce HPOS compatibility by definition

**WDD Decisions from WPDM Research:**
- Adopt ad blocker detection feature for Downloads module
- Adopt "play but don't download" for video files
- Adopt dark/light/system color scheme toggle in admin UI
- Adopt dynamic payment link concept as a WooCommerce quick-buy mechanism
- Adopt 2-click checkout concept via Digital Goods Checkout integration (§1.11)
- Adopt order expiration as a WDD entitlement feature (already planned)

### 1.10 Digital License Manager (DLM)

**URL:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/digital-license-manager/
Free + Pro | 700+ installs | 4.7/5 | Updated Feb 2026 (v1.8.4) | By CodeVerve

DLM is a WooCommerce extension for selling and managing license keys. It is the closest free direct competitor to WDD's Licensing module.

**DLM Free — what it covers:**
- Licenses table with search, filter, edit
- Activations table — each activation as a DB row (not a counter): stores IP, user-agent, label, environment
- License Generators — configure key format/length/character sets
- Deliver from stock (pre-generated) OR from Generator (dynamic) per product
- Stock sync: product stock count = available license count in DB
- Simple and Variable product support
- Configurable delivery order status
- My Account: licenses list + single license page with activation log
- Manual activation from My Account (customer can activate without API call)
- PDF License Certificate download
- License key in order confirmation email + re-send from admin
- REST API: Licenses, Generators, Software CRUD + auth by API Key
- CSV import/export with duplicate check
- HPOS compatible
- Gutenberg blocks: Licenses Table + License Check Form
- Shortcodes for the above
- Refund handling with configurable behavior (added v1.7.1)
- Per-item `_dlm_license_id` order meta for developer access
- Migration tool from "License Manager for WooCommerce"
- Client libraries: PHP, C++, C#, Python
- Uses `defuse/PHP-Encryption` — stores key files in `wp-content/uploads/dlm-files`
- Removed jQuery entirely — uses Tom-Select + Flatpickr

**DLM Pro — what requires paid upgrade:**
- WooCommerce Subscriptions integration (sync license expiry to sub status)
- Software Releases (publish releases per software, gallery, changelog)
- Software Download page in My Account
- Software Download REST API endpoint
- WordPress plugin/theme auto-updater
- WPML support
- License Revealing (blur key until customer clicks)

**WDD vs DLM:**
| Feature | DLM | woo-digital-downloads |
|---|---|---|
| Key generation | Generator (configurable format) | `random_bytes()` — cryptographically secure |
| Activation tracking | DB row per activation with IP/UA/label | Same + environment (staging/local) + geo |
| Staging exemption | No | Yes — auto-exempt staging/local from limits |
| Remote kill-switch | Suspend via admin | Instant REST revocation |
| Plugin update API | Pro only | Built-in (Phase 1) |
| GitHub sync | No | Yes (Phase 4) |
| SaaS provisioning | No | Yes (Phase 2) |
| Subscription sync | Pro (needs WC Subscriptions extension) | Built-in subscription engine |
| PDF certificate | Yes (free) | Not planned initially |
| Client libraries | PHP, C++, C#, Python | PHP only (v1), expand later |
| Encryption | defuse/PHP-Encryption | Encrypt in DB + rotating keys |
| Works without WooCommerce | Yes | No — WooCommerce extension only |

**WDD Decisions from DLM Research:**
- **PDF License Certificate** is a meaningful feature — add to roadmap (Phase 3 or later, use `spipu/html2pdf`)
- **Manual activation from My Account** — let customers activate without API. Add to My Account license tab.
- **License Revealing** (blur key, click to reveal) — good UX. Adopt in My Account.
- **Copy to clipboard** button on license key display — adopt everywhere
- **Per-item `_wdd_license_id` order meta** — already planned; confirm it matches DLM pattern
- **Migration tool** — build a DLM → WDD migration tool for v1.1
- **Tom-Select instead of Select2** — confirm WDD admin also avoids jQuery for dropdowns
- Encryption: store encrypted in DB, key file in `wp-content/uploads/wdd-keys/` — document backup requirement

### 1.11 Digital Goods Checkout for WooCommerce

**URL:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-checkout-for-digital-goods/
Free + Pro | 3,000+ installs | 4.5/5 | Updated May 2026 (v3.8.4) | By Dotstore

A focused WooCommerce plugin that removes unnecessary billing/shipping fields from checkout when the cart contains only virtual/downloadable products.

**What it does:**
- Removes: company, last name, address lines, city, state, postcode, phone, country
- Optional: remove order notes field
- Quick checkout button on shop page and product page
- Mixed cart aware: only activates when ALL products are digital
- HPOS compatible, Blocks compatible
- 41 reviews, 4.5/5 stars — "works exactly as needed"

**Pro features:**
- Apply to specific categories/tags only
- Delayed account creation (after payment)
- Post-payment additional fields
- User role restrictions

**Known issue:** Conflict with FluentCRM SMTP driver (one user report).

**WDD Decision:**
WDD should build this behavior directly into its checkout module rather than requiring a separate plugin. The existing §6.6 Checkout Optimization covers this. Specifically:
- `woocommerce_checkout_fields` filter to remove address fields when cart is digital-only
- Quick checkout button: a `[wdd_quick_checkout]` shortcode option
- The Pro's "delayed account creation" pattern is useful for WDD's "optional account creation" UX goal
- Document the FluentCRM SMTP incompatibility pattern — avoid hooking `wp_mail` filters

### 1.12 ArraySubs — Subscriptions + Membership

**URL:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/arraysubs/
Free | 80+ installs | No reviews yet (launched March 2026) | By Emran

ArraySubs is a comprehensive free WooCommerce subscription + membership plugin. It is the most feature-complete free alternative to WooCommerce Subscriptions discovered in WDD research.

**What's free (complete list of notable features):**
- Subscription products: simple + variable, per-variation configuration
- Billing: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom day intervals, lifetime
- Free trials with one-trial-per-customer enforcement
- Sign-up fees + different renewal pricing after N cycles (stepped)
- Renewal sync: align all renewals to a shared calendar date
- 2-phase grace periods: Active grace (default 3 days) → On-Hold grace (7 days) → Cancellation
- Skip next renewal (configurable max skips + cutoff)
- Pause/vacation mode (configurable duration + cooldown + auto-resume)
- Plan switching: upgrades, downgrades, crossgrades — 3 proration methods
- **Retention flow builder**: cancellation reasons → 4 offer types (discount, pause, downgrade, contact support) → confirm
- **Retention analytics**: 8 KPI cards, churn reasons chart, offer distribution, trend chart, activity logs
- Customer portal: full self-service in WooCommerce My Account
- Member access control: 6 rule types, 9 condition types, 12 operators, nested AND/OR
- Role mapping: assign WP roles based on subscription status (7 status behaviors)
- Member-only discounts (percentage/fixed, per-product or per-cart)
- Members-only commerce: hide/block products for non-members
- Content restriction + URL restriction + download restriction (signed URLs)
- 16 email notifications (13 customer + 3 admin) with 50+ placeholders
- Refund management: 3 policies, prorated refunds with preview
- 9-step setup wizard with 7 business type profiles
- Settings export/import (JSON, section-level)
- Custom profile fields + avatar upload
- My Account editor (drag-drop menu reorder, custom endpoints)
- Login as User (admin impersonation, 6 entry points, nested sessions)
- HPOS compatible, Block checkout compatible
- CSV/JSON subscription export

**WDD vs ArraySubs:**
| Feature | ArraySubs | woo-digital-downloads |
|---|---|---|
| Subscription engine | Full built-in | Full built-in (planned) |
| Retention flow | 4 offer types + analytics | Not planned (Phase 5+) |
| Member access control | 6 rule types | Not in scope |
| Content restriction | Yes (posts, pages, CPT) | Not in scope |
| URL restriction | Yes | Not in scope |
| Download restriction | Signed URLs | Full token + IP + geo |
| License keys | No | Yes (Phase 1) |
| Plugin update API | No | Yes (Phase 1) |
| SaaS provisioning | No | Yes (Phase 2) |
| GitHub sync | No | Yes (Phase 4) |
| Geo-blocking | No | Yes (Phase 3) |
| JWT for SaaS auth | No | Yes (Phase 2) |
| Focuses on WooCommerce | Yes | Yes |

**WDD Decisions from ArraySubs Research:**
- **Retention flow** (cancellation reason → offer → confirm) is a high-value subscription feature. Add to Subscriptions module roadmap (Phase 2 extension).
- **2-phase grace period** (active grace → on-hold → cancel) is the right pattern. Adopt for WDD dunning: `_wdd_sub_active_grace_days` + `_wdd_sub_onhold_grace_days` settings.
- **Skip next renewal** — add to customer My Account portal for WDD subscriptions.
- **Pause/vacation mode** — add with configurable max duration and cooldown.
- **Plan switching with 3 proration methods** — adopt: Prorate Immediately / Apply at Renewal / No Proration.
- **Renewal sync** (align all renewals to a fixed calendar date) — useful for subscription box scenario. Add to WDD Subscriptions.
- **Login as User** — add to WDD admin tools (helps support staff debug customer issues).
- **One-trial-per-customer enforcement** — prevent trial abuse. Add `_wdd_trial_used` user meta check.
- **Stepped renewal pricing** (different price after N cycles) — store as `_wdd_sub_step_price` + `_wdd_sub_step_after` product meta.
- ArraySubs' download restriction uses signed URLs — confirms WDD's token approach is correct.
- ArraySubs' role mapping (assign WP roles on subscription status) — add as optional WDD feature.

### 1.13 Payment Gateways — Reference

**WooCommerce Stripe:** 700,000+ installs, free, 23 payment methods, Stripe Radar, Apple/Google Pay, BNPL. WDD hooks into Stripe-fired renewal events.

**WooCommerce PayPal Payments:** 800,000+ installs, free, PayPal + Venmo + Pay Later + Fastlane + Apple/Google Pay + Crypto. WDD hooks into PayPal-fired order status events.

---

### 1.14 JWT Authentication — Library Research

**jwt-auth (usefulteam):** 6,000 installs, 5.0/5, has refresh tokens + rotation. NOT updated in 2+ years — WP 7.x untested. Single-developer risk.

**JWT Authentication for WP REST API (tmeister):** 60,000+ installs, 4.4/5, React admin dashboard, actively maintained. No refresh token in free tier — Pro required.

**WDD Decision:** Use `firebase/php-jwt` directly in `includes/SaaS/JwtIssuer.php` — avoids namespace collisions, plugin conflicts, and external dependency risks. HS256, 10-min access tokens, 30-day refresh tokens stored server-side.

---

## 2. Competitor Feature Gap Analysis

**Features none of the researched competitors handle for WooCommerce natively:**
- Automatic plugin update delivery tied to WooCommerce order (DLM Pro only)
- GitHub/Bitbucket private repo → auto ZIP build → update API (no competitor)
- JWT-based SaaS account provisioning from WooCommerce checkout (no competitor)
- Geo-blocking on file downloads (no competitor)
- Remote license kill-switch (no competitor)
- Staging/localhost exemption for site-limit licenses (no competitor)
- WooCommerce order → SaaS account creation webhook flow (no competitor)

**Features competitors do have that WDD should match or exceed:**
- PDF license certificate (DLM free) → WDD roadmap Phase 3
- Manual license activation from My Account (DLM free) → WDD My Account tab
- License key "copy to clipboard" (DLM free) → WDD My Account + order page
- 2-click / quick checkout for digital-only carts (Digital Goods Checkout) → WDD checkout module
- Ad blocker detection on download page (WPDM) → WDD Downloads module
- Video play-but-no-download protection (WPDM) → WDD Downloads module
- Retention flow builder on subscription cancellation (ArraySubs free) → WDD Subscriptions Phase 2
- 2-phase grace period on subscription payment failure (ArraySubs) → WDD dunning engine
- Skip next renewal + pause/vacation mode (ArraySubs free) → WDD customer portal
- Stepped renewal pricing after N cycles (ArraySubs free) → WDD subscription product config
- Dark/light/system color scheme toggle in admin (WPDM) → WDD admin panel

## 3. Project Architecture
